            This utility was created so I could script specific mundane tasks into automated sequences. 
            The goal was simple, create a way to a script simple tasks without any type
            of api given by the program itself. This uses the win32 modules for python to 
            save x and y coordinates of the screen of where to click next. After creating a simple clicking scenario,
            I created this utility to help me record my actions more quickly and put it into it's own scenario. 
            Code will be given upon request.

            This game was created using python and the pygame module. The game uses the random 
            function to generate each horses movement. 
            Once a horse reaches the finish line, the game will check what horse you chose and 
            tell you that you either won or lost and allow you to play again. This was to be a prototype 
            for a similar game that I plan to create for android. 
            Code will be given upon request.

            This project was made for a html and javascript course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. 
            The goal was to create a form for a person to enter a range of numbers and generate its
             multiplication table from it. Further more I was able to add code that would allow the user 
             to see the row and column highlighted when hovering over a cell. 
             This code can be used here <a href="http://jaredjacob667.github.io/multForm/">http://jaredjacob667.github.io/multForm</a>

            "At That" was a project designed for the Difference maker project at the 
            University of Massachusetts Lowell. The goal was to work with create a prototype
            for his android/business idea. The idea behind the app was to give students incentive
            to attend more events on campus by providing a reward system for attending events. The 
            app was to use the gps on the phone an time the user at an event and give points
            that would late be used to get prizes. Working with a team of 3 student developers, 
            we created a prototype application that
            was to be shown for the pitching of the idea.
            Prototype code can be found here <a href="https://github.com/jaredjacob667/ATThat">https://github.com/jaredjacob667/ATThat</a>
